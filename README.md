[![][Build Status img]][Build Status]

Library for injecting Akka Actors with Google Guice

This library's functionality is provided also with [com.typesafe.play:play-guice](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.typesafe.play%20AND%20(a:play-guice_2.12%20OR%20a:play-guice_2.13)),
but that library just for using ActorRefProvider requires full Play Framework.
